Features

- Detects potentially fraudulent credit card transactions based on historical transaction data.
- Utilizes machine learning models for classification, anomaly detection, or other fraud detection methods.
- Provides a sample Jupyter Notebook with an end-to-end fraud detection example.
- Customizable and extensible for different use cases and datasets.

Usage

- Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb) to see an example of how to use the fraud detection system.
- Customize the system for your specific dataset and requirements.
- Train and evaluate the machine learning models included in the notebook.
- Monitor and fine-tune the system as needed to improve fraud detection performance.

Dataset

-We used the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/ dataset in CSV format. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle if needed.

Dependencies

-The project required the following Python libraries: pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn and so on

Setup

-You can run this project on platforms like Colab or Jupyter.

Results

-We have included screenshots of the output in the documentation section of Phase 5 so that users can view the results.
